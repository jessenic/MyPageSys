				Okay, let's test how it looks with this kind of box around the blog post.. Haha, funny. Imagine there were hundreds of these
				boxes full of usefull content. That would be super awesome. But first i must program this baby!

				This looks pretty cool with this new style. I removed that ugly box around this post and now it looks amazing! Just little more
				php code and the blog system is done and then i can send this to my friend..

				Awesome features! I should program BBCode integration to the next version of MyPageSys. This is MyPageSys Beta 0.1 the next is Beta 0.2. I'll release
				it to public on Beta 0.6 when most of it's features are ready.

				Hello! I'm just testing how it looks like when there are many posts at the same time on the screen. I'll make it show 3-5 posts on the frontpage and then
				you must click next page to see more posts. I'll but easy navigation in the blog to the main page always availbe. But now i must think and figure what
				other features i must add.
